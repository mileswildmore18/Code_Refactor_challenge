# Code_Refactor_challenge
This is the first coding challenge in UCF Bootcamp.
I organized the code for the website in a way that the coders are able to understand and avoid confusion.
I also combined all the duplicate settings in each class to simplify the codes to save time for coders.
Finally, I got rid of unnecessary codes that are not part of the CSS such as the ID.
