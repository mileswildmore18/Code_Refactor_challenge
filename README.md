# Code_Refactor_challenge
This is the first coding challenge in UCF Bootcamp.
I organized the code for the website in a way that the coders are able to understand and avoid confusion.
I also combined all the duplicate settings in each class to simplify the codes to save time for coders.
Finally, I made sure the search engines navigate to their correct locations.
